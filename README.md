# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose

In this module, I have understood what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. I put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for my clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, they has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I have decided on a clustering algorithm. I’ll use data visualizations to share my findings with the board.
